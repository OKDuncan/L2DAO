# L2DAO

The L2 DAO formed on the back of the MolochDAO project which looked to create a community in the name of advancing ETH 2.0. In compliment to this effort, individuals within the blockchain ecosystem have come together to put funds toward appreciating and advancing efforts in the off-chain tx and computation space available today. This DAO idea was incepted during Devcon V in Osaka, Japan.
